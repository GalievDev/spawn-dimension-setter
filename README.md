# Spawn Dimension Setter

With this mod you can change the world you spawn in.

Changes need to be made to the *config.json* file.

**Example:**

```json
{
    "dimension": "minecraft:the_nether",
    "safeCheck": true,
    "rangeX": 100000,
    "rangeZ": 100000
}

```

**dimension** - is responsible for the world in which you appear.

**rangeX and rangeZ** - Responsible for the range from 0 coordinates.
